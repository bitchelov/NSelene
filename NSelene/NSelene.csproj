    <Title>NSelene - User-oriented Web UI browser tests in .NET (Selenide port from Java)</Title>
    <PackageTags>selenium;webdriver;wrapper;web;browser;test;automation;autotest;selenide;selene</PackageTags>
    <PackageDescription>
    NSelene is a wrapper over Selenium Webdriver, built to provide user-oriented API for Web UI tests in Browser and improve tests stability by implementing smart implicit waiting for commands and assertions. It's inspired by Selenide from Java, SelenideJs from JavaScript and Selene from Python.

    Main features:

    - User-oriented API for Selenium Webdriver (code like speak common English)
    - Dynamic/Ajax UI support (Smart implicit waiting and retry mechanism for commands and assertions)
    - PageObjects support (all elements are lazy-evaluated objects)

    Tests with NSelene can be built either in a simple straightforward "selenide' style or with PageObjects composed from Widgets i.e. reusable element components.

    <PackageReleaseNotes>
- turned off "waiting for no overlay" that was built-in in alpha05 in all actions. ([#85](https://github.com/yashaka/NSelene/issues/85))
  - cause it could break some NSelene + Appium mobile tests that can't use JS, while this waiting was built on top of JS so it's relevant only for web... 
  - yet the Configuration.WaitForNoOverlapFoundByJs was added (false by default)
    - so you can turn it on globally by Configuration.WaitForNoOverlapFoundByJs = true
    - or per element by element.With(waitForNoOverlapFoundByJs: true)
  - in future we might made this waiting enabled by default, when we provide better docs and plugins to work with Appium
- added rendering of elements under overlay into errors ([#84](https://github.com/yashaka/NSelene/issues/84))
  - made rendering elements HTML â€“ lazy (when waiting for no overlap)
    - should improve performance in context of polling during waiting
